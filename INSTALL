Installation
============

The Astronaut build tools provides very simple and straightforward way
to compile and install the package. The only thing you have to do is
to download the source or clone the repository and run `make` command:

   $ git clone git://github.com/webrocket/astronaut.git
   $ cd astronaut
   $ make

If everything will go properly, then you should find a static library
in the `./build` directory.

Usage
-----
To use the Astronaut toolkit in building your full stack WebRocket's
*Backend Worker Protocol* client, check the documentation and manual
entries for 'astronaut(3)'.
