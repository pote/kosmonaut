Astronaut - The WebRocket client toolkit
========================================

The 'astronaut' library is a toolkit to build efficient clients for
the WebRocket link:http://rfc.webrocket.io/draft/BWP.html[*Backend
Workers Protocol*].

IMPORTANT: This is not a full stack client, it's just a low level
	framework which helps to build clients in other programming
	languages without dealing with ZeroMQ magic and quirks.
